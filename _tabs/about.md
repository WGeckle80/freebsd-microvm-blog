[Port FreeBSD to QEMU microvm](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2025Projects/PortFreeBSDToQEMUMicrovm)
is a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project led by mentors
[Tom Jones](mailto:thj@freebsd.org) and
[Mehdi Mokhtari](mailto:mmokhi@freebsd.org) of the
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) community. Its goal is to port FreeBSD to
[QEMU microvm](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/i386/microvm.html): a
low dependency and lightweight virtual machine modeled after Amazon's
[Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/). The project's
motivation, as well as a detailed overview of the initial progress made by
Tom Jones is documented at <https://adventurist.me/posts/00320>.

The project's GitHub repository is located at
<https://github.com/WGeckle80/freebsd-src/tree/microvm-port>.
